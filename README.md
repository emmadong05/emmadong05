### About Me
Hi, I'm Emma â€” a Computer Science student at Carnegie Mellon University.  

I've worked as a **Fullstack Android Engineer** at [Silo Markets](https://www.silomarkets.com/), where I developed a trading platform with user onboarding, portfolio analytics, and bond/stock trading features.  

My projects include:  
- [**Kitty Klicker**](https://github.com/emmadong05/KittyKlicker): A rhythm-based Java Swing game designed to help children with cerebral palsy improve fine motor skills and coordination through interactive graphics and music.  
- [**Delta: Competitive Reeling**](https://github.com/emmadong05/competitive-reeling): A Chrome extension that curbs short-form media addiction by analyzing reels with a Vision LLM and kNN keyword scoring, syncing results to a gamified web dashboard.  

Beyond software, my academic and research interests include algorithms, computer systems, fairness in machine learning, and game development.  

Feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/emmad6688).
